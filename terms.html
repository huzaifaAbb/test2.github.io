            platforms. You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your
            failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or
            expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or Elixir Labs.

            that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account license

            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password that you designate
            during the registration process, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your
            username and password. You agree to (a) immediately notify the Entity of Elixir Labs of any unauthorized use
            of your username or password or any other breach of security to try and resolve the situation, and (b)
            ensure that you exit from your account after a session of usage to prevent unauthorized use or any breaches
            of security any further. Elixir Labs is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to
            comply with this provision. You should exercise caution when accessing your account from a shared or public
            computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information. If you
            share your computer with others, you may wish to consider disabling your auto-login feature if you have it
